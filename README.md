# Scheduling the Appointment
It is a simple application to make a schedule fix and after fixing then it automatically saves the event in google calendar and then we notification or mail by google.

Here I added google authentication by the help console.google.cloud
and in backed we imported googleapis to manage refresh tokens and
in frontend we imported react-google-login

This are some sample ScreenShots.
