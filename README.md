# Scheduling the Appointment
It is a simple application to make a schedule fix and after fixing then it automatically saves the event in google calendar and then we notification or mail by google.

Here I added google authentication by the help console.google.cloud
and in backed we imported googleapis to manage refresh tokens and
in frontend we imported react-google-login

By the help of this we made direct access to our drive and application.![Screenshot (74)](https://github.com/Rakeshreddysr2401/calender/assets/102222142/49cec381-e88b-4b41-9a5a-55bdd401b27a)
